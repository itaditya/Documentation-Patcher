# Description
Many times we need to read the documentation of Bootstrap and other awesome utilities. However all of them provides the source code in only vanilla HTML. However with the advancement in technologies used in Web Development vanilla HTML is written sparingly instead we use React.js and write code in JSX.
Many times we use templating engines like Pug/Jade, Handlebars and Mustache. Now Pug.js has a specific problem and that is it's usage of indentation to mark the block instead of the good o'l open and closing tags. Due to this we can't just copy an example from a libraries documentation and throw it in our code. We need to convert it into Pug first **manually and repeatedly** . 

To get around that you can use this chrome extention to automagically patch the documentation code examples into your favourite Templating Engine. Sounds cool right !! Let me know your thoughts.
